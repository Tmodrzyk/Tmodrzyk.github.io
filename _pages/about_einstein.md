I'm a 1st year PhD student in Deep Learning applied to medical imaging at the CREATIS lab. My interests are in the application of diffusion models to inverse problems and to the Compton Camera reconstruction problem. 

I graduated from the [*Data & Intelligence for Smart Systems*](http://master-info.univ-lyon1.fr/DISS/) Master's degree from the Computer Science department of Claude Bernard Lyon 1 University. I've done a 6 months research internship at [Thales](https://www.thalesgroup.com/fr) for my Master's thesis, focusing on Deep Learning applied to subresolved infrared target detection.
