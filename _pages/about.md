I'm a 2nd year PhD student in Deep Learning applied to medical imaging at the CREATIS lab. The subject of my thesis is about deconvolution applied to the Compton Camera for SPECT imaging. My research interests are Plug-and-Play methods, Score / Diffusion models, and Poisson inverse problems.

I graduated from the [*Data & Intelligence for Smart Systems*](http://master-info.univ-lyon1.fr/DISS/) Master's degree from the Computer Science department of Claude Bernard Lyon 1 University. I've done a 6 months research internship at [Thales](https://www.thalesgroup.com/fr) for my Master's thesis, focusing on Deep Learning applied to subresolved infrared target detection.
