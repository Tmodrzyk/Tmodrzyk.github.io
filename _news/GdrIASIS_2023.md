I attended a workshop about the state of the art of tomographic reconstruction. The workshop was held in Lyon, on the Universit√© Claude Bernard Lyon 1 campus. 
Diffusion models and deep learning in general were very presented all along the workshop. People in the tomographic community seem to prefer plug-and-play approaches, because they are more related to traditional iterative techniques.

I had the pleasure to hear a talk from [Marion Savanier](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marion-savanier-4898ab12b/?originalSubdomain=fr) about plug-and-play methods for PET reconstruction. I also enjoyed the talk from [Corentin Vazia](https://www.theses.fr/s348527) who is trying to apply diffusion models to tomographic reconstruction.
