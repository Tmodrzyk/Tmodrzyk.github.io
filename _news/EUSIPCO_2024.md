During the last week of August 2024, I had the pleasure of attending the 24th European Signal Processing Conference in Lyon.
I really enjoyed the conference, which brought me a lot of new experiences. In fact, I was both presenting my work and being part of the staff, which was a very good experience.
Seeing the backstage of the conference was very interesting and I got to enjoy some extra delicious lunch boxes.
I was lucky enough to present my poster on the first day, which attracted a lot of people, many from different countries.
I had the pleasure of talking to fellow signal processing enthusiasts from South America, Japan, Lebanon, and Germany, to name a few.

The poster I presented.

I attended several talks, including one by [Julian Tachella](https://tachella.github.io/) and [Mike Davies](https://www.eng.ed.ac.uk/about/people/professor-michael-e-davies) about [Equivariant Imaging and Self-Supervised learning](https://tachella.github.io/projects/selfsuptutorial/) which was super interesting.

I also attended the signal processing and speech oral session, which was pretty interesting even if I'm not familiar with the domain.
Finally, I enjoyed [Tara Sainath's](https://sites.google.com/site/tsainath/) talk on end-to-end speech recognition, but found the applications a little underwhelming to be honest. It's a shame that DeepMind seems to have abandoned their "fully on-device" approach, as I think it could have a lot to offer to the world of LLMs.
