[DIPOpt Workshop](http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/nelly.pustelnik/DIPOpt/)

***

During the last week of November I attended a workshop in Lyon about Deep learning, image analysis, inverse problems, and optimization.
The workshop was held at ENS Lyon and featured reknown speakers such as [Michael Davies](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dwmfR3oAAAAJ&hl=en) or [RÃ©mi Gribonval](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EcqbX1QAAAAJ&hl=en).

On tuesday evening I had the chance to eat with [Adrien Taylor](https://scholar.google.be/citations?user=tcRn4JYAAAAJ&hl=fr) who is working on worst-case performance estimation for first-order optimization methods.

On the last day [Julian Tachella](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=u_hH-fUAAAAJ&hl=es) presented a python framework for inverse problems named [DeepInv](https://deepinv.github.io/deepinv/) to which I would love to contribute to.
