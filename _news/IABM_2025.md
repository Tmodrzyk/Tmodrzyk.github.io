[IABM 2025 Nice](https://iabm2025.sciencesconf.org/)

***

I attended the national conference on Artificial Intelligence for Biomedical imaging in Nice.
The place was awesome but I stayed only half a day because I took holidays on the same week.
The few hours there were still fun though. I presented a poster on the adaptation of my algorithm to the blind setting.
