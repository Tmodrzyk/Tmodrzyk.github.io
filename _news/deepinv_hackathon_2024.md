During the last week of October I was invited to participate to a Hackathon, aiming at developing the Deepinv python library. 
It was very pleasant, my first time in Marseilles and the weather was really nice.
I had the chance to meet many fantastic people, all passionate about the same field. Most of us were PhD students or postdocs
It was a very nice occasion to meet other people with the same interests, and from very diverse backgrounds.
For example, I enjoyed engaging conversations with Florian Sarron and Hai Nguyen from the University of Toulouse, both of whom work under [Pierre Weiss](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=mH4DvxQAAAAJ&hl=fr). 
I also had insightful discussions with Jérémy Scanvic and Nils Laurent from ENS Lyon.
Another highlight was meeting Andrew Wang from Edinburgh, who was incredibly friendly.
I’m already looking forward to the next event, where I hope to meet and collaborate with even more inspiring individuals.
