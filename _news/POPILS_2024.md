***

On the 16th of February I attended the workshop **Parcimonie, Optimisation et Problèmes Inverses Lyon Saint-Etienne**. It was held at the Marie Cury library of INSA Lyon.

There I followed the talks of several people including [Loic Denis](https://perso.univ-st-etienne.fr/deniloic/) from the [Hubert Curien lab](https://laboratoirehubertcurien.univ-st-etienne.fr/en/index.html) in Saint Etienne. He presented some of his and his team's work, which are mostly image processing related, with applications to SAR and other modalities. Most importantly he presented some of his work about *spatially variant deconvolution* applied to astonomy [[1](https://ujm.hal.science/ujm-00979825v2/document)] [[2](https://hal.science/hal-00618696/document)].

I also had the pleasure to talk with [Theo Santos](https://www.linkedin.com/in/th%C3%A9o-santos-740865152/?locale=en_US) who is a PhD student at [Centre de la Recherche Astronomique de Lyon](https://cral.univ-lyon1.fr/?lang=fr). He also works on deep learning applied to deconvolution and other inverse problems such as tomographic reconstruction. His work is mainly focused on building a prior with GANs. He talked about the work of [Olivier Flasseur](https://olivier-flasseur.github.io/), who works on exoplanet detection and is already well-known in his field of research.
