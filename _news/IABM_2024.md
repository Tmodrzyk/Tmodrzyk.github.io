[IABM 2024](https://iabm2024.sciencesconf.org/)

***

I attended the IABM 2024 conference in Grenoble this week. The conference focused on the applications of artificial intelligence to biomedical imaging.
During the conference, I had the opportunity to present my poster to [Cedric Villani](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A9dric_Villani) the Fields medal laureate of 2010 and former head of Institut Henri-Poincar√©.

During the conference, I attended several talks. One that stood out to me was given by [Loic Boussel](https://primes.universite-lyon.fr/labex-primes/site-francais/navigation/qui-sommes-nous-/consortium/membres/loic-boussel--22632.kjsp), head of radiology at Hospice Civil de Lyon (HCL) and member of CREATIS. Additionally, I found [Maxime Sermesant](https://team.inria.fr/epione/en/team/maxime-sermesant/)'s talk on heart modelling to be particularly interesting.
